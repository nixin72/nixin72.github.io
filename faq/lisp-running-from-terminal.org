* Question:
How do I run lisp code from my terminal in vscode? 

There are a few different ways that you can do it, and it depends on what compiler you're
using. Refer to the section for your compiler. 

** SBCL:
With SBCL there are two options you'll care about, ~--script~ and ~--load~. 


<<script>>
*** ~--script~
The first of the two will be most like running a Python script or something like that. You pass it 
a file, it'll evaluate the file, write to your terminal, and then exit. 

So if we have the following file:

#+begin_src lisp
;; filename.lisp
(print "hello world")
#+end_src

And then we run this in the terminal:

#+begin_src bash
$ sbcl --script filename.lisp
"hello world"
$
#+end_src

You can see that it'll execute the file, print things, and then exit.

<<load>>
*** ~--load~

If you use ~--load~, then it will evaluate everything in your file, and then drop you into an
interactive prompt so that you can interact with your program:

So let's say we have the following file:

#+begin_src lisp
;; filename.lisp
(defun sum (list)
  (if list (+ (car list) (sum (cdr list))) 0))
#+end_src

And we call ~--load~ in the terminal:

#+begin_src bash
$ sbcl --load filename.lisp
#<some preamble about sbcl you can ignore>
,* (sum '(1 2 3 4 5))
15
#+end_src

Then as you can see, we're able to interact with our program, call functions defined in our file and
stuff like that right from our terminal.

When we're interacting with Lisp like this, we can also reload our file without ever exiting from
Lisp, so we can do:

#+begin_src bash
$ sbcl --load filename.lisp
#<some preamble about sbcl you can ignore>
,* (sum (list 1 2 3 4 5))
15
# Make some changes to our filename.lisp file
,* (load "filename.lisp")

T
,* (new-function-that-wasnt-there-before)
NIL
#+end_src

** CCL
CCL mostly has one argument for using it at the terminal that you'll care about, which is the ~--load~
argument. When you give CCL the ~--load~ argument, it will drop you into an interactive prompt the
same way that it will do when using ~--load~ with SBCL. Refer to the section about [[load][~--load~]] for SBCL.

** CLisp
CLisp can be used almost the same as SBCL, with a couple differences. You have two main options with
CLisp for how to execute your Lisp files. You can either execute the entire Lisp file and terminate
the program after the file is done, or you can load the program into an interactive prompt and
interact with your program.

To run a file and terminal, simply do:
 #+begin_src bash
$ clisp filename.txt
 #+end_src
 
To know more about how this works, refer to the [[script][~--script~]] option for SBCL. Just keep in mind that
anywhere that the ~--script~ option is provided in SBCL, you want to ignore that flag.

 To load a file and interact with it, you use the ~-repl~ option. To learn about how to use this
 option, you can refer to the [[load][~--load~]] instructions for SBCL. Just keep in mind to replace any
 instance of ~--load~ with ~-repl~.
