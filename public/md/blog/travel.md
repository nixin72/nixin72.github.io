From June to December 2024, my wife and I decided to take 6 months off of working to get married
and travel the world. In that time we spent 2 months in the Pacific North West, Eastern Canada,
Peru, Mexico, the South Western United States, and Japan. These travel posts are mostly just a
personal recounting of that for myself for the sake of memories.

We spent most of the summer in the Pacific North West, mostly in Seattle. While there we spent
most of our time planning for our wedding, while getting out hiking in the surrounding areas.
We spent half a week out on the Olympic Peninsula, time in the Cascades, as well as the Pacific
Mountains in British Columbia north of Vancouver. After getting married, we came back home to
Montreal for a few weeks, hopping down to the Adirondaks for some hiking.

In early October, we embarked on the next two months of travel from Peru, up the western seaboard
to Vancouver, and then across the Pacific to Japan.
