# Japan

From November 19th to December 11th, we travelled Japan, seeing the major sites
like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, but getting well off the beaten path and hiking
the Nakasendo Way and the Kumano-Kodo, and visiting Okinawa.

### November 19th / 20th: Tokyo

We arrived in Tokyo on November 19th. While we'd chosen to visit Peru on a
guided trip to avoid the planning, we didn't hae anything guided here. We also
didn't have time to plan anything beforehand. So our first day in Tokyo, we
went out to visit Asakusa for a little bit in the morning, then spent most of
the afternoon booking and scheduling our travel for the rest of our time in
Japan. We only had 1 night booked for the next 3 weeks, so we hopped on
Google Maps and AirBnB and planned out the rest of our trip. Our one
accomodation booked was along the Nakasendo, so we went to a Yamato transport
to stumble our way through a conversation over Google Translate to get our
luggage shipped from Tokyo to Kyoto. We left here pretty sure we'd communicated
this correctly and that our luggage would be waiting for us in Kyoto, and we
went back to our hotel for the night with just out hiking packs with clothes
for a couple days.

The next morning we hopped on a train south towards Kyoto. We knew nothing
about the trains, and so accidentally got on an express
