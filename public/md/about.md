Hi! I'm an intermediate level software developer with a wide array of experiences.
From the fast pace of startup culture to the public service, I've worked on distributed
systems, mobile applications, front-ends, backends, developer tooling and more.
I love learning new things and teaching others, and I'm a big advocate of functional
programming.

Currently I'm just back home in Montreal from taking 6 months off work to get married and travel
the world! My wife and I travelled through Peru, Mexico, the United State, British Columbia, and
Japan from June to December 2024. I plan on [writing about it here](/blog)!

### My Background
Before starting in university, I completed a 3-year technical degree in Computer Science from
Heritage college in Gatineau, Quebec. This program was invaluable to me, and shaped my view of
programming. I spent two summers before university working as a full-stack developer for
TechInsights, and 2 semester in college working as a TA.

### Personal Interests
Outside of Computer Science or programming, I love going rock climbing and being outdoors. I love
camping and hiking in the summer, and during the winter I enjoy going out skiing and skating.
Being from Ottawa, I've been spoiled all my life by the Rideau Canal,
