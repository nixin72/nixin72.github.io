Working as both an intern and a part-time contractor, I contributed to the GitHub Learning Lab

- Starting as an intern, worked on making a public API for the GitHub Learning Lab
- Learned the GitHub REST API to model ours off of that
- Implemented secure requests via API tokens
- As a contractor, designed and created a few projects for people to follow to learn various programming languages
