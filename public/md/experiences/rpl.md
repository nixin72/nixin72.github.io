Worked on a very small team developing Rama, a new bleeding edge distributed systems platform for the JVM

- Supported customers by fixing immediate client-facing issues
- Supported the team by making QoL improvements to the codebase and developer tools
- Ensured the codebase was compatible between all LTS versions of Java
- Took ownership of the system front-end, improving code design and adding automated testing
- Published open-source code on GitHub
