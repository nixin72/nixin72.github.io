## Passionate. Creative. Optimistic. Developer.

Hi, my name is Philip! I'm a 20 year old software developer living in Montreal Canada. I'm passionate about Computer Science, technology, and it's ability to empower people. 
My personal interests in Computer Science are in compilers and programming languages, and teaching others to code.  

### About Me 
Born and raised in Gatineau, I went to CEGEP Heritage college where I feel in love with Computer Science. Now I'm currently in my first year of Computer Science at Concordia University in Montreal. 


### Projects
I'm constantly thinking of new projects that I'd like to try out. My biggest problem is that I can never finish my own projects! So I'm hoping this website will be an exception to that...

- **Project-Icarus**
  - An interpreter for Lisp written from scratch. I'd like to make this into an actual usable language at some point, and so I can't decide what language to build this in... I've got versions in JavaScript, Rust, and beginnings of one in Python. 
- **Project-Horus**
  - This started out as a nodejs framework that I built while working for a company, but they didn't take on the idea. Now I've continued to develop it a little, but it's fell on the backburner right now. My image for this project is a language-agnostic web development framework allowing using any language to develop it with it's own build system and use of metadata in JSON. 
- **LeDocubot**
  - This project hasn't had much momentum, but I'm working with a friend to learn a little bit about GitHub's Probot framework for developing GitHub extensions. It's supposed to be a tool that will auto-document some amount of JavaScript and TypeScript code when you make pushes to GitHub. 

### Blog
I've wanted to start a programming blog for a long time. So I'm finally trying it! My focuses in the blog are in delving into technologies that most people are perhaps unfamiliar with to give insights into how diverse the field of Computer Science is.
