Taught the fundamentals of functional programming in COMP-348, programming languages and paradigms

- Taught students the basics of C, Ruby, Common Lisp, and Prolog.
- Made supplemental material for students to improve their knowledge of Lisp.
- Made a website in my spare time to help students by providing an FAQ, help setting up programming environments, and providing practice questions.
- Researched difficult questions when I couldn't provide answers in class so I could follow up later.
- Helped students outside my normal hours, answering questions on Discord and by email.
