I'm no writer, but my old boss [Nathan Marz](http://nathanmarz.com/about/) is
an avid writer, author, and someone I aspire to as an engineer. He frequently
told me when I was working at Red Planet Labs that I should try writing, as
it helps you think about things more concretely. One of the reasons I enjoy
tutoring and teaching is for the same reason - explaining a concept to someone
else forces you to try and put your knowledge into a more digestible form.
Since I have no one to teach anymore, perhaps I can try to write instead.
