# Hi, my name is Philip! 

I'm a passionate developer living in Montreal Canada, currently attending Concordia University. Interning at GitHub this summer in San Francisco!

## My Background
Before starting in university, I completed a 3-year technical degree in Computer Science from Heritage college in Gatineau, Quebec. This program was invaluable to me, and shaped my view of programming. I spent two summers before university working as a full-stack developer for TechInsights, and 2 semester in college working as a TA. 

## Personal Interests 
Outside of Computer Science or programming, I love going rock climbing and being outdoors. I love camping and hiking in the summer, and during the winter I enjoy going out skiing and skating. Being from Ottawa, I've been spoiled all my life by the Rideau Canal,
