# Hi, my name is Philip! 

I'm a passionate developer living in Montreal Canada currently attending Concordia University. 

## My Background 
I'm from Gatineau Canada, which for anyone from Gatineau is pretty much all the same city with Ottawa, but with the perks of living in Quebec. As such, I went to CEGEP and got to experience a 3 year technical program in Computer Science, which is where I first fell in love with software development. 


## Projects 
### Project-Icarus
This is my main project that I work on. It's a Lisp compiler (interpreter for now I suppose) written in a number of different languages because I couldn't settle on what to build it in. 


## Personal Interests 
Outside of Computer Science or programming, I love going rock climbing and being outdoors. I love camping and hiking in the summer, and during the winter I enjoy going out skiing and skating. Being from Ottawa, I've been spoiled all my life by the Rideau Canal,
