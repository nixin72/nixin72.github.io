# Free Donuts 

So today I learned something interesting - giving away donuts to university students cramming for finals is a lot harder than I expected. 

This year in university I was living in residence and had to buy a meal plan. 
I recently learned (last week - with less than a month of school left), that along with my "all you can eat" in the cafeteria, I *also* got $200 "flex dollars" that I can use at a few places on campus. 
Now, everywhere is closed at this point because it's finals except for the Tim Horton's and Starbucks we have in our library. 
So today I decided that I would buy a box of 12 donuts and give them out for free. 

I went up to the study room and sat down, sent a message to my university's Discord server telling everyone there was donuts, and then just went to studying. 
An hour went by and no one came for donuts. I went back onto the server and sent another message, asking people to come get donuts. 
Still, the only replies I got were "I'm at home, I can't". 
So confused at the fact that in a server of 1000 people I couldn't find anyone who wanted to come and get a donut, I decided to open up the box and put a sign next to it saying "Free donuts!".
*Still*, no one came to eat the donuts. So now I've been sitting here with this box of 12 donuts for almost 2 hours and not a single person has taken one. 
I suppose I'm going to have to get up and walk around offering them to people, because giving away donuts to uni students is apparently a lot harder than I expected.
